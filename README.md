** Kantara Proposal **
With the support of CISWG, the newly formed Open Consent Group is looking for a commitment of $7,500 in funding from Kantara Initiative to support the development and deployment of the consent receipt specification.  Matching funds would be constributed from another source.

Contributions will be used to engage resources to support the use of CIS work product with the I DON'T AGREE Campaign being launched for Privacy Day January 28, 2016 and ends on Privacy Day 2017.  s

The campaing website will have  a button that people can press to campaign for open source consent technology.  This will register support and interest, and people/companies can optionally fill in a survey. 

In 2017 the aim is to createa button that actually use open consent to Not Agree to terms and services. 

Privacy Day 2016 will kick off the project, and start the educational campaign to support the year long project. The optional survey will be for research about the button and the project.   
 


** Key Benefits **

-       CIS-WG consent receipt approaches and techniques would be greatly advanced by having them tested in a real world situation.

-       Kantara Initiative would become visible to a large number of organizations

-       The funds also include a gold sponsorship package, which consists of; prominent branding, a short video, landing page, and a report,

 Summary Description
The ‘idontagree.org’ campaign was developed at a MIT Un-conference on Nov20-22. It has now grown into a project proposal for a campaign to create real open consent. Starting on Privacy Day 2016, and finishing on Privacy Day 2017.  A rallying call to Open Consent. 

In order to make this plan plausible the strategy is to progress the project in stages:
1.	Stage 1: launch a marketing campaign for Privacy Day on Jan 15 or 18th, to market the action, and the countdown to 12:12 on privacy day Jan 28,.  
2.	Stage 2: Start a campaign to support the effort. 
a.	A survey for people 
b.	A survey for companies
c.	Project Kit
i.	in the US for People to create legal consent and data control requests "do you have data about me" and if so, to request "access to the data about them".
ii.	In the UK/EU a Project kit for people to  submit a standard request for a consent record, and for open path  to manage consent. 
d.	For Privacy Day 2016, this starts with a survey and a letter to companies. 
e.	Engaging discussion on interaction with companies 
f.	If funds permit a PR and communications company my be drafted in to help with the communications and public interaction 
3.	Stage 3: Post Jan 28, a report will be made with the research and a series of workshops, projects and funding campaigns will be designed to develop interoperability of consent requirements, specifications, and if possible standards.
4.	Primary research that will inform this campaign will come directly from Digital Ranking and Eurobarometer. 
5.	The Project will feed back into work at the Consent & Information Work Group 
a.	consent receipt
b.	user submitted terms
c.	information sharing label

The research data is then used to promote consent technology and integration.  the new Consent Tech community at openconsent project is then completion the project can be used to develop a realtime privacy day project for Privacy Day 2017. 

Working on the project in stages offloads 80% of the project work to be ready after Jan 28th privacy day, in the context of the longer vision of the project. 

(note: Before project can be launched on 15 of jan the project will have Privacy Impact Assessment.)
 
Working Hypothesis
-	Consent receipts create trust by:
-	That people can independently manage consent externally from a company, and do so with multiple companies at once, with the press of a button. 
-	That if companies accepted people’s consent preferences that people would be more able to trust companies. 
-	If people can withdraw consent and permission to use personal data, regardless of contract, that people will have greater trust and engage more fully with brands
-	That the data and business people want to provide companies is more rich/valuable than the data and customer relationships that companies get by stalking without permission
-	Education and awareness of consent management. How Open Consent can scale consent for easy use by people in the future.
The Problem
The two way infrastructure for people to communicate about consent and preferences is missing.  This means that their is an impossible expectation and burden for people to be able to mange consent, data sharing and protect their data with policy.   Even for simple tasks, like a subject access request, is hampered by the requirement to engage with each organisation separately.   

This project will aim to provide a common format for privacy policy discussions transparency so that    people can view their consent on aggregate.  (Note: this requires picking companies that a participant already engages with)  
Solution
Create this campaign and through this effort develop the needed education and awareness about personal data control, enabling the easy use of digital rights, with transparency and innovation.

Generic Proposal:
 
As promised, here is the follow up sponsorship proposal that I mentioned last week.   As you are aware, the world is looking to the UK’s response to new data protection law and the reaction to the fall of Safe Harbor.   As a result we are developing a Privacy Day campaign that is timed to coincide with these new market developments.
 
The Open Consent Group is at the fore front of developing ‘Consent Tech’, researching and engineering consent management and developing the  tools for for both people and companies to communicate about consent and control of data. 
 
As an admirer of the [X] brand we would like to extend this invitation to advertise your brand and product to people on consent receipts that will be provide during the campaign.  This would provide a channel for people to advertise to companies what their consent presences are and directly link people with your [Brand] product in the context of personal privacy and security.

Join us and support a campaign that will provide cutting edge research into the emerging market of personal data control, which is expected to eclipse advertising and identity management marketplace in value.  Early indications are that the market for personal data management can grow to as much as 1 Trillion dollars by 2020.

Sponsorship Proposal
 
We would like to invite you to participate as a sponsor of a beautiful civic campaign for Privacy Day, January 28, 2016.  The aim of this campaign is to provide a way for people to communicate with companies about consent independently of a company silo’ for Privacy Day. 
 
Data protection and privacy laws in the EU are being announced in January 2016, this is a critical time for people and companies to develop ways to communicate about consent and access to data.  This privacy day campaign is a call to action to open consent and solve the terms and condition issues that are effecting privacy. 
 
The I Don’t Agree campaign aims to provide people with a way to advertise what they want to companies and a way for companies to better understand how to engage with people about policy.  
 
The Privacy Day Campaign will provide people with:
UK Version
 
1. 	A way for people to register and sign a consent petition providing Education and awareness about personal data rights under existing mandatory statutes and regulations.
2. 	Provide a road map to make a workable method for people to exercise those rights, initially in 2016 starting with a way for People to request "do you have data about me" and if so, to request "access to the data about them". 



We will then provide people with a new consent record to link to the activities for this project and get updates on the run up to Privacy Day – Jan 28, 2017. 
 

This campaign was developed at a MIT during an un-conference, Nov 22, 2015 and this information should be viewable  at law.MIT.edu.  The specifications for this are developed by a group of experts in privacy and data control who participate in the Consent & Information Sharing Work Group at the Kantara Initiative.    As a result we are focusing our campaign in the US and the UK, for 2016, and with its success, are already planning a global campaign for Privacy Day 2017.
 
The campaign will provide incredible opportunity for organisations and companies that are active in the security, privacy and data control space to gain very valuable research about the emerging marketplace for consent, and promote their service in the context of privacy and trust.   
 
Sponsorship Packages
 
We are looking for a minimum of 3 sponsors for the UK who will be a champion of the people.
