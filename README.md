A campaign that begins on Privacy Day, January 28, 2016 and ends on Privacy Day 2017.  s

It will start with a button that people can press to campaign for open source consent technology.  This will register support and interest, and people/companies can optionally fill in a survey. 

It will end with a button people press to use open consent to manage identity and control the access and use of personal data. 

For Privacy Day 2016, People can start to sign up to support the for 2017. The optional survey will be for research about the button and the project.   This will come with a roadmap of workshops and open calls to discuss different aspects of consent technology.  A space for companies or projectrs interested in consent tech  can post an intro. 

Then, with a years worth of collaboration, build an open service for  Privacy Day, where people can manage their consent and hence access to personal data.
